# TheSVGLogoMaker

## About
This applications makes simple logos. 

## Description
This is a command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, amd save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file. This application solves the problem of spending time and money for a graphic designer to design a logo. This application was built with Node.js, Jest, and Inquirer. This project was very challenging and will be improved upon for future development to be fully functional.

## Installation
Invoking node index.js

## Usage
Open integrated terminal on index.js. Then enter "noe index.js" in the command line. The user will be presented with 4 questions and be prompted to answer them. Once the questiona are answered, a SVG file named "logo.svg" will be created.
